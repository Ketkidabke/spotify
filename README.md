This project is aimed at building a music recommendation system for Spotify using machine learning techniques. 
The system analyzes user preferences, historical listening data, and various features of songs to provide personalized recommendations.
Data
The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation system is obtained from the Spotify API. It includes user listening history, song features (such as acousticness, danceability, energy, etc.), and user ratings.

Model
The recommendation system employs a collaborative filtering approach, utilizing user-based and item-based models. Additionally, content-based filtering is used to enhance the accuracy of recommendations by considering song features.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques are applied to ensure the robustness of the recommendation system.

Results
The results of the recommendation system are presented in terms of accuracy, user satisfaction, and user engagement. User feedback is collected and analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the system.
